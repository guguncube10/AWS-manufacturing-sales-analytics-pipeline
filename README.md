# **AWS Manufacturing Sales Analytics Pipeline**
Build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for manufacturing sales analytics using AWS services, integrating QuickSight for business intelligence and SageMaker for advanced analytics.

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern, cloud-native data analytics platform that transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. Using real-world sales data spanning orders, customer accounts, regions, and sales representatives, we'll build a comprehensive AWS-based solution that showcases enterprise-level data engineering capabilities.

### **What We'll Achieve:**

1) Technical Excellence: Demonstrate proficiency in AWS data services, MLOps practices, and modern data architecture patterns through a production-ready pipeline that processes multi-dimensional sales data
2) Business Value: Create predictive analytics for sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and performance optimization that directly impacts revenue and operational efficiency
3) Career Advancement: Build a portfolio-worthy project that showcases end-to-end data engineering skills, from raw data ingestion through advanced machine learning deployment

### **Key Business Outcomes:**

1) Automated sales performance dashboards
2) Predictive models for sales forecasting with 85%+ accuracy
3) Real-time insights into regional performance and customer behavior patterns

## üìÅ Data Sources

The project leverages a rich dataset containing customer orders (transaction-level revenue data), account information (customer demographics and rep assignments), regional data (geographical performance analysis), and sales representative details (individual performance tracking) to create a complete view of sales operations and drive strategic decision-making.
 
### üìÅ Dataset Components:

1) Orders Dataset: Customer orders with dates, total amounts (USD), and customer IDs - enables revenue trend analysis, purchasing behavior insights, and seasonal pattern identification https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/sales-dataset-of-different-regions?select=orders.csv
   
2) Accounts Dataset: Customer account information including IDs, names, and sales rep assignments - provides customer demographics and engagement metrics https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/sales-dataset-of-different-regions?select=accounts.csv
   
3) Regions Dataset: Geographical regions with names and IDs managed by sales representatives - supports regional performance analysis and comparative insights https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/sales-dataset-of-different-regions?select=region.csv
   
4) Sales Representatives Dataset: Rep data including IDs, names, and assigned regions - enables account-to-region mapping and individual performance analysis https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/sales-dataset-of-different-regions?select=sales_reps.csv
